# Gravitational wave study
The following events will be studied:
* GW151226 (SNR ~13, multimodality, from the Zaldarriaga paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03508](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03508))
* GW190521 (SNR ~14.7, the primary BH mass is in the pair-instability mass gap: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01190](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01190))
* GW190412 (SNR ~19, has higher-order modes: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08342))
* GW200129\_065458 (SNR ~28, “best case”, strong precession evidence and also a lensing candidate: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01302))
